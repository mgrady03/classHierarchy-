This program defines a base class, Shape, that has two properties, area and perimeter, and two abstract methods, calculateArea and calculatePerimeter. It also defines two subclasses, Rectangle and Circle, that inherit from Shape and implement their own versions of the abstract methods.

In the main method, the program creates instances of Rectangle and Circle and sets their properties. It then calls the calculateArea and calculatePerimeter methods on each instance and logs the results to the console. This demonstrates inheritance, polymorphism, and other object-oriented programming concepts.
